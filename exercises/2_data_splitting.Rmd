```{r, setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_knit$set(root.dir = here::here())
```

```{r, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
## load packages:
library(dplyr)
library(mlr3verse)
```

## Learning goals

Be able to...

- define and utilize different data splitting techniques,
- compare and interpret evaluation results depending on the experimental designs.

## Introduction

From previous exercise 

```{r}
# Load data:
data_ctg <- readRDS("data/data_ctg.rds")

# Task definition:
task_ctg <- as_task_classif(data_ctg %>% select(-Year),
                            target = "status",
                            positive = "suspect",
                            id = "task_ctg")

task_ctg$set_col_roles("status", add_to = "stratum") 
# -> more about this line in upcoming session on "data splitting"...

task_ctg
```



## Setup: algorithms \& hyperparamers 

```{r}
## How many hyperparameters should we sample randomly per algorithm?
n_hp <- 50 

## Prepare multisession:
future::availableCores()
n_threads <- round(0.8*future::availableCores())
future::plan("multisession")
```


```{r}
## Prep learner glmnet:
ts_glmnet <- mlr3tuningspaces::lts("classif.glmnet.default")
learner_glmnet <- ts_glmnet$get_learner()
learner_glmnet$predict_type <- "prob"
set_threads(learner_glmnet, n = n_threads)
learner_glmnet

set.seed(123)
space_glmnet <- learner_glmnet$param_set$search_space()
hp_glmnet <- generate_design_lhs(space_glmnet, n_hp)
hp_glmnet
```


```{r}
## Prep learner ranger:
ts_ranger <- mlr3tuningspaces::lts("classif.ranger.default")
learner_ranger <- ts_ranger$get_learner()
learner_ranger$predict_type <- "prob"
set_threads(learner_ranger, n = n_threads)
learner_ranger

set.seed(123)
space_ranger <- learner_ranger$param_set$search_space()
hp_ranger <- generate_design_lhs(space_ranger, n_hp)
hp_ranger
```



## 2.1 Train-tune-test split (20 min)

### Task

Derive a random train-tune-test (60-20-20) split such that by explicitly three sets of indices (row_ids). Hereby, make sure to set the random seed first and to stratify the splits for the outcome variable.

- `train <- ...`
- `tune <- ...`
- `test <- ...`

Instantiate an appropriate **mlr3** object storing this information via

```{r, eval=FALSE}
design_ttt <- rsmp("custom")
design_ttt$instantiate(task_ctg,
                       train_sets = list(...),
                       test_sets = list(...))
```

What about refitting the best model after tuning (on training + tuning data)? 
How could we represent this in **mlr3**?


### Solution 

```{r}
## train-tune-test:
# -> https://mlr3.mlr-org.com/reference/partition.html

set.seed(123)
r <- rsmp("cv", folds = 10)$instantiate(task_ctg)

split_ttt <- list(
  train = filter(r$instance, fold %in% 1:6) %>% "[["("row_id"),
  tune = filter(r$instance, fold %in% 7:8) %>% "[["("row_id"),
  test = filter(r$instance, fold %in% 9:10) %>% "[["("row_id")
)

sapply(split_ttt, length)


train_sets_ttt <- list(split_ttt$train, # tuning
                       c(split_ttt$train, split_ttt$tune)) # evaluation

test_sets_ttt <- list(split_ttt$tune, # tuning
                      split_ttt$test) # evaluation


design_ttt <- rsmp("custom")
design_ttt$instantiate(task_ctg,
                       train_sets = train_sets_ttt,
                       test_sets = test_sets_ttt)
design_ttt$instance %>% str()
```






## 2.2 Nested cross-validation

### Task

Define a nested CV design with 5 folds for the outer loop and a simple holdout design for the inner loop (75% training, 25% tuning).
(It is sufficient to define two independent designs for outer and inner loop respectively via `rsmp()`.)

### Solution

```{r}
## nested cv (outer: 5fold CV, inner: 75/25 holdout):
# https://mlr.mlr-org.com/articles/tutorial/nested_resampling.html
designs_ncv <- list(
  outer = rsmp("cv", folds=5),
  inner = rsmp("holdout", ratio=0.75)
) 
```




## 2.3 Temporal data split

### Task

Similar to tasks 2.1 and 2.2, create a temporal data split. For this, we want to utilize data from 
one year for training and data from the next year for testing.


- What is different for this splitting strategy compared to cross-validation?
- Are there other temporal splits that may be reasonable here? 

### Solution

```{r}
## temporal transferability:
train_sets_tmp <- list(
  which(data_ctg$Year == "1995"),
  which(data_ctg$Year == "1996"),
  which(data_ctg$Year == "1997")
)
test_sets_tmp <- list(
  which(data_ctg$Year == "1996"),
  which(data_ctg$Year == "1997"),
  which(data_ctg$Year == "1998")
) 

design_tmp <- rsmp("custom")
design_tmp$instantiate(task_ctg,
                        train_sets = train_sets_tmp,
                        test_sets = test_sets_tmp)
design_tmp$instance %>% str()
```

- Internal-external validation (accessing temporal transferability) instead of internal validation.
In addition, not all subsets of the data have equal size.
- E.g. train in 2 years, test in the next year.



## 2.4 Model training and selection (for completeness only, no tasks here)

After hyperparameter tuning, we need to select models for testing/evaluation. 
Neither tuning, nor model selection are shown here directly as this would be out of scope
for this course.
If you are interested in the code and/or want to reproduce the results, you can examine the script `"scripts/2_rwd_ctg_model_dev"` for that matter.

To continue with our ultimate goal, model evaluation, we will load the pre-computed evaluation datasets.

```{r}
data_eval_ttt_2 <- readRDS("data/data_eval_ttt_2.rds")
head(data_eval_ttt_2)
```

```{r}
data_eval_ncv_2 <- readRDS("data/data_eval_ncv_2.rds")
head(data_eval_ncv_2)
```


```{r}
data_eval_tmp_2 <- readRDS("data/data_eval_tmp_2.rds")
head(data_eval_tmp_2)
```

This leaves us with 3 evaluation scenarios:

- ttt: models tuned via simple hold-out, the two respective winners (glmnet vs. ranger) are evaluated on the test data (after refitting)
- ncv: models tuned in inner loop of nested CV, the two respective winners (glmnet vs. ranger) are evaluated in the outer loop (after refitting, one model for each of the 5 folds)
- tmp: for a sensitivity analysis, we use the respective best hyperparameters for the glmnet and random forest from the train-tune-test design and evaluate the "winners" again for the temporal split (train one year, evaluate next year)
(note that for a really consistent evaluation an independent "inner" loop is missing here...)


## 2.6 (Hypothetical) comparison of evaluation designs

For a real-world ML problem, we would decide for a single experimental design a priori. 
In this exercise, we will compare different evaluation approaches for learning purposes. 

### Task

For each design mentioned in section 2.5, calculate test performance estimates, initially for the AUC. 
(`pROC::roc()` and `pROC::auc()` should be helpful for this.)
Here, you should report the individual performances (ranger, glmnet) and, in addition, the difference
of performances for comparison (ranger - glmnet).

Note that for nested CV, you have to write a small custom loop or function that calculate the metric
per fold and then average the results for an overall (expected) performance assessment.

When you are done, repeat with other metrics (tasks, design, ...) and try to interpret the results.


### Solution

```{r}
## Custom function to avoid code repetition:
evaluate <- function(data_eval){
  auc_ranger <- pROC::roc(response = data_eval$truth, predictor=data_eval$prob.suspect_ranger,
                          levels = c("normal", "suspect")) %>% pROC::auc()
  
  auc_glmnet <- pROC::roc(response = data_eval$truth, predictor=data_eval$prob.suspect_glmnet,
                          levels = c("normal", "suspect")) %>% pROC::auc()
  
  auc_delta <- auc_ranger - auc_glmnet
  
  return(
    data.frame(auc_ranger=auc_ranger, 
               auc_glmnet=auc_glmnet,
               auc_delta=auc_delta)
  )
}

evaluate_cv <- function(data_eval, aggr=mean){
  lapply(sort(unique(data_eval$fold)), function(i){
    data_eval %>% filter(fold==i) %>% evaluate()
  }) %>% 
    do.call(rbind, .) %>% 
    apply(2, aggr)
}
  
```

```{r}
## naive results (ignoring existence of different folds):
results <- rbind(
  evaluate(data_eval_ttt_2),
  evaluate(data_eval_ncv_2),
  evaluate(data_eval_tmp_2)
)
  
rownames(results) <- c("ttt", "ncv", "tmp")

results

```

```{r}
## valid results for ncv and tmp split:

results <- rbind(
  evaluate(data_eval_ttt_2),
  evaluate_cv(data_eval_ncv_2),
  evaluate_cv(data_eval_tmp_2)
)
  
rownames(results) <- c("ttt", "ncv", "tmp")

results
```
